# Audio stuff

I can use this to prototype digital synthesizers if I create reasonable base classes for audio signals and
control signals. This would let me deal with fixed-point issues and detect overruns. For just getting
algorithms to work in the first place, or for purely software synths running on fast processors, I could
use floating point signals.
